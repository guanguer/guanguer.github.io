			Since I was a child, I was always passionate about discovering how things work, disrupting all kinds of things that were in my house, to then put them back together. My mother told me that I could harm even a bullet, because everything I took would mess it up, and most of the time I would not be able to put it together again.	
		</p>        
		<p>
			For a long time, in my career, I lost some of that curiosity and anxiety that I had when I was a child, perhaps because I let myself consume day-to-day and did not take the time to ask why.			
		</p>
		<p>
			In recent months I have felt like a child again, and I must say that there are several reasons. One, my three little daughters who make me think like a child again; another, feeling stuck in my career, and feel the need to learn something new every day to regain the pace of personal and professional growth.			
		</p>
		<p>
			I recently read a series of books that I think you should read over and over, by author Kyle Simpson (@getify), called "You Don't Know JS", which focuses on explaining how things work behind the scenes In javascript, in a very entertaining and very easy to understand way.			
		</p>
		<p>
			This has made me find in javascript and Front End technologies an inspiration to learn something new and take a new look in my career. For the same reason I decided to create this page, to put into practice some concepts of which I am learning and to share with other people those learnings.			
		</p>
		<p>
			I hope that I can reach someone with what I do here, and I can awaken in someone else the desire to be an eternal apprentice.
